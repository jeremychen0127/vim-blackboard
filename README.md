# vim-blackboard
a colorscheme which ported from sublime text

## Difference

* Not just convert from sublime text' blackboard
* More close to display in sublime text
* Custom NERDTree colors instead of use the syntax's colors
* More beautiful gutter and split
* More syntax keywords, works great with vim-javascript
* May be more...
